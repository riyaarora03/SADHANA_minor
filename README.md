## Future Scope

In this section, we discuss the scope of our project in future and how we can expand this endeav- our. The following points indicate the future scope of this project.
1. Privacy and Data Security Measures: Prioritize robust privacy and data security measures, especially when implementing features like video conferencing. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and use encryption protocols to safeguard user information during live in- teractions with meditation instructors.
2. Transparent AI Decision-Making: Enhance transparency in the AI algorithms powering the chatbot. Provide users with clear explanations of how the chatbot processes information, makes recommendations, and handles user data. Transparency builds trust and helps users understand the limitations of the technology.
3. Instructor Verification and Quality Assurance: If connecting users with experienced instruc- tors through video conferencing, implement a rigorous verification process for instructors. Ensure that instructors meet specific qualifications and adhere to ethical guidelines. Regularly assess and monitor the quality of instructor-led sessions.
4. Social Integration: Enhance social integration by allowing users to share their meditation achievements, insights, or favorite practices on social media platforms directly from the website. This can contribute to a supportive online community.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
